  [`2469ccf`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/2469ccfba1a6afad4af6658a777dc735767c5625)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Trim the cold path of a first
  mount: `template_el` builds nested templates and builds a master in the document
  itself unless the compiler flagged a resource-loading element; Firefox is
  detected without reading `navigator` (about 0.1 ms on a fresh page);
  `Event.prototype.__root` is declared with the first delegated listener instead
  of at mount; `set_attribute` skips the property-setter walk for `data-` and
  `aria-` names; the first flush of a mounted app's effects runs in one phase;
  `track()` and deferred component effects call one function less each; and a
  mount before any delegated event is registered attaches no listeners.

  New `set_attribute_value` and `set_property_value` helpers write an attribute
  the compiler classified with the Web IDL setter table, so a standard element
  never triggers the descriptor walk of `set_attribute`.

### Patch Changes

- [#1496](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1496)
  [`0473e93`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/0473e93006e53cd15fcf6d851443d427ccf13e8b)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Update `@tsrx/core` to ^0.2.3
  and use its SVG and MathML tag-name predicates for dynamic class handling,
  removing the compiler's duplicate tag-name list.

- [#1490](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1490)
  [`ff3a26a`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/ff3a26acef0c9584cf41d32bc8cbcc39d863d74c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Blocks keep the namespace
  they were created in when they rerun. A dynamic element whose tag changes, an
  `@if` that toggles, or an `@for` that grows inside an SVG that is only known at
  runtime (children rendered into a component's `<svg>`, a leaf component rendered
  there) now creates its elements in the SVG namespace instead of HTML, and a
  nested template cloned in that context no longer throws before a namespaced
  template has been parsed. A dynamic element whose tag becomes `foreignObject`
  renders its children as HTML.

- [#1488](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1488)
  [`b3bf787`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b3bf78756d9235412a2af264e42897652e8f911e)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Build a template that is one
  element with static attributes and at most a text child with DOM calls instead
  of parsing it. Parsing a `<template>` has a fixed cost that dwarfs such an
  element, and an app's first render pays it once per distinct template; a chain
  of 100 single-element components mounts about 35% faster.

- [#1495](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1495)
  [`1b8381f`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/1b8381f31f98f84049764ca56676fc320721e844)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Faster element spreads,
  dynamic elements and list items. An element spread is applied from the element's
  own render function instead of a render block of its own, and a spread object
  identical to the one applied last is skipped without a diff (a spread of a
  tracked object or of tracked values is always diffed). A dynamic element
  (`<{tag}>`) is one block that owns its element and applies its attributes
  itself; a tag that does not change keeps its element and diffs the attributes,
  so a swap between variants with the same tag no longer recreates the element. An
  `@if` whose condition reads tracked state is evaluated by the render function of
  the enclosing content (a list item's, an element's), so the if keeps a block for
  its branch but not one that runs the condition. A dynamic element or component
  called inside an `<svg>` or `<math>` template receives the namespace as an
  argument instead of a `with_ns` closure. A dynamic element without children is
  driven by the render function of the content it sits in, with no block or
  closures of its own (`_$_.dynamic`); a build that can hydrate lets a composite
  block claim the server element while hydrating. With `textTypes`, an attribute
  value TypeScript proves to be a string is set with a direct `setAttribute` call,
  and a proven `class` takes the string-only path. On the SVG dashboard benchmark,
  mounting is about 20% faster and swapping 150 dynamic icons 40% faster.

- [#1486](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1486)
  [`304ba6c`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/304ba6c2d9098752396fff6c2545e3ef2546381c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - perf: a static component,
  template `@if`, or template `@for` followed by a static element sibling inserts
  before that element instead of before a `<!>` placeholder of its own: the
  element is part of the template and never moves, so the compiled template holds
  no comment node for it and the client reuses the element's variable where
  hydration steps to the sibling. The `RippleArray` statics (`from`, `of`,
  `fromAsync`) lower to standalone runtime functions, so a bundle that never
  constructs a `RippleArray` drops the array proxy instead of keeping it through
  property assignments on the constructor's compiled form (the server's
  `fromAsync` lowering previously named a function that did not exist).

- [#1487](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1487)
  [`b4abea0`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b4abea0ab4830eed99adf14dc95a0ef214b24af1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - perf: smaller production
  bundles without a runtime cost. The compiler lowers a static `onBlur`-style
  handler (an event its name keeps off delegation) to a direct `listen` call with
  the DOM name and phase resolved at compile time, packs the locals a hoisted
  `@if`/`@switch` captures under positional keys, writes template strings without
  attribute quotes or implied end tags where the parser reads them back the same,
  gives a plain function no `_$_.scope()` call when its body never reads the
  block, and omits `set_class`'s default trailing arguments. The runtime keeps its
  hydration paths (template adoption, expression text, append cursor, streamed
  boundaries) in a module `hydrate()` installs and its `trackAsync` machinery in a
  module that registers with the runtime on first use, and the catch routing is
  registered by the first boundary, so a client-only mount without `trackAsync`
  ships neither and the core runtime no longer imports the boundary module; the
  try boundary state, the root event ref and the template cache use short keys,
  the keyed and reference list diffs share one patch helper, and symbol constants
  carry no descriptions. The runtime's errors are thrown as in Svelte: the message
  and a link to `https://ripple-ts.com/e/<code>` in development, the link alone in
  production, so the message text stays out of production bundles; `set_class`
  composes non-string values with its own clsx-style joiner instead of importing
  `clsx`; hoisted render blocks store captured locals under positional keys; a
  `template()` with no flags passes none; and the hash a `track()` call carries
  encodes the same 32 bits in base 36. The Vite plugin leaves Vite's modulepreload
  polyfill out of production builds unless `build.modulePreload` is configured.

- [#1487](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1487)
  [`b4abea0`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b4abea0ab4830eed99adf14dc95a0ef214b24af1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - feat: build shapes.
  `ripple({ ssr: false })` builds a client-only app: components compile without
  the hydration cursor or `track()` serialization hashes (`hydration: false` on
  the compiler), the runtime's hydration paths are compiled out through its
  `HYDRATION` build constant, and `hydrate()` throws; `ssr: true` compiles every
  module for the server. `prerender()` on `ripple/server` renders a component to
  static HTML with every boundary settled and the CSS as text, and a `RenderRoute`
  marked `prerender: true` is rendered through the built server entry at build
  time into `<outDir>/client<path>/index.html`, which the node and bun adapters
  now serve for a directory request before the server renders. The client build's
  `index.html` template moves to the server output so a static handler never
  serves its placeholders.

- [#1487](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1487)
  [`b4abea0`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b4abea0ab4830eed99adf14dc95a0ef214b24af1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - perf: a `class` expression
  the compiler can prove to be a string writes through a string-only `set_class`,
  so the clsx-style joiner ships only with a bundle that composes classes from
  arrays or objects; templates in the SVG or MathML namespace parse through a
  `template_ns` entry that an HTML-only bundle never loads; and the class joiner
  is one module shared by the client and server renderers, so `ripple` no longer
  depends on `clsx`. `ripple({ rootBoundary: false })` builds an app that renders
  without the default root try/pending/catch boundary and leaves the boundary
  runtime out of the bundle; a `rootBoundary` option on `mount()` or `hydrate()`
  then throws. The `ripple` package declares `sideEffects: false`, and dynamic
  attribute, style and spread helpers live in their own runtime module, so a
  bundle that never sets an attribute dynamically drops them along with the
  attribute tables they consult. The plugin's `ssr: false` and
  `rootBoundary: false` rewrite the runtime's build-constant imports to literals
  at transform time, which every bundler folds while tree-shaking.

- [#1484](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1484)
  [`1ea71f1`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/1ea71f14fcee5a976ea81e2bedf5010251eaa70c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - perf: a template `@if` that
  closes the trailing run of an element's children (nothing rendered follows it)
  never materializes an anchor node: the element's tail is its position for its
  whole life. An `@if (outer === item.key)` in a `@for` body lowers to the loop's
  selector like an attribute comparison, and a comparison against the item's key
  reads the block's key (fixed for its life) rather than the item, so a change of
  the outer value re-runs the ifs of its previous and next key alone and a
  replaced item leaves its ifs untouched; comparisons against the same outer value
  share one selector per loop. Event delegation reads the composed path only for a
  nested root and looks the handler property up by one string, and `checked` is
  compared against the element instead of a cached write.

- [#1487](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1487)
  [`b4abea0`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b4abea0ab4830eed99adf14dc95a0ef214b24af1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - `trackReadOnly(value)`
  replaces the `readOnly()` method on tracked and derived values: it returns a
  derived that follows a tracked or writable derived, or a read-only derived as it
  is. The method is removed, so `count.readOnly()` becomes `trackReadOnly(count)`,
  imported from `ripple`. Dropping the prototype methods lets a bundle that never
  takes a read-only view leave the code out.

### Patch Changes

- [#1478](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1478)
  [`1032539`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/10325392e4b1ec7fba78b8ddaf57bc5376adaab1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Faster buffered server
  rendering. Static text and attribute values are emitted with characters above
  U+00FF as numeric character references (raw-text elements such as `<script>`
  excluded), so a server response stays a one-byte string whenever its dynamic
  data is Latin-1 too: a single static em dash no longer widens the whole body to
  two bytes per character, which halved the flatten, byte-length and UTF-8 encode
  cost of a page. The runtime text escaper checks for `&` and `<` with two
  single-character searches instead of a regex test.

- [#1481](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1481)
  [`e9382ed`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/e9382ed7538779aeb8671b8e3f3fdfd3a897b85a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Cheaper text-only elements
  and typed loop items. An element whose only child is a typed text expression
  (`<td>{row.name}</td>`) is cloned without a placeholder text node and written
  through the element (`set_text_content`): the first write creates the text node
  with `textContent`, later writes update it in place, and hydration adopts the
  server-rendered text with no cursor descent, which removes a DOM read and a text
  node per cell from every list row. A keyed `@for` key callback reads the item
  directly instead of unwrapping it. Type inference now follows a binding's
  declared type through property writes (`items.value = next` no longer hides
  `track<Row[]>()` from the loop item) and through array and tuple indexing
  (`row.queries[0].elapsed`), so those reads lower to direct text updates in one
  render block per row.

- [#1483](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1483)
  [`5de359e`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/5de359e430391b0e1609795b42d26161fd5c2ff9)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - perf: a list item without a
  tracked of its own (a plain list's item, or a local keyed item) is created
  through a lean first run (`run_branch`) instead of the generic block runner:
  fewer checks and no re-run bookkeeping per item.

- [#1482](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1482)
  [`0030be0`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/0030be0aa3c7f1d2ce40500dc57ea980b69c69ec)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - perf: cheaper keyed lists. A
  `@for` or `@if` that trails template siblings appends into its parent element
  instead of inserting before a `<!>` placeholder. A list item whose updates live
  in one render block carries that block on the item block itself (`_$_.item`),
  and a keyed item that only its render block reads is held as it is instead of in
  a tracked, re-running its block directly when the key's item is replaced. Leaf
  text is written without a DOM read, from the value the render block last wrote.
  A keyed diff that re-lays most of its items walks the range front to back
  instead of appending every item at the end, about half the reorder cost in
  Chromium and far less right after a layout flush.

  [`670d669`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/670d66916a0b2d58254adb3248abc9d3e816fd8d)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Use property-specific CSS
  types for HTML and SVG style objects and export `CSSProperties` from `ripple`
  and `ripple/jsx-runtime`. Numeric lengths such as `width: 400` now produce a
  type error; specify units with `width: '400px'` or `width: '24rem'`. Unitless
  CSS properties, zero lengths, camelCase and kebab-case names, and CSS custom
  properties remain supported.

  Style properties set to `null` or `undefined` are omitted during server
  rendering and removed on the client, matching the nullable and optional property
  types and supporting conditional style values. Ripple does not infer or add CSS
  units.

  Re-export the `JSX` and `Ripple` namespaces as types from `ripple` so element
  prop and event types can be imported from the main package. The
  `ripple/jsx-runtime` exports remain available.

- [#1472](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1472)
  [`5d3e60d`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/5d3e60d86129ac20d23c86a923914ee44efea9d1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Lazy destructuring is removed
  from the language (tsrx RFC
  [#106](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/issues/106)). `&[ ... ]` and
  `&{ ... }` are syntax errors now; a tracked value is read and written through
  `.value`, and a `Tracked`, `Derived`, or `WritableDerived` object is passed to a
  child as it is (`<Child {count} />`, or `count={track(() => count.value)}` for a
  read-only view).

  | Before                                                           | After                                                                    |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `let &[count] = track(0); count++; {count}`                      | `const count = track(0); count.value++; {count.value}`                   |
  | `let &[count, countT] = track(0); <Child count={countT} />`      | `const count = track(0); <Child {count} />`                              |
  | `let &[double] = track(() => count * 2)`                         | `const double = track(() => count.value * 2)`                            |
  | `function Card({ count: &[count] }: { count: Tracked<number> })` | `function Card({ count }: { count: Tracked<number> })` and `count.value` |

  `Tracked<V>`, `Derived<V>`, and `WritableDerived<V>` are plain `{ value: V }`
  shapes; the `[V, Tracked<V>]` tuple member, the runtime `[0]`/`[1]` accessors,
  and the `lazy_array_*` helpers are gone, and `count[0]` reports the ordinary
  "use `.value`" error. Rest and default patterns lower to native destructuring: a
  keyed `@for` pattern with a rest element or a default is destructured once per
  item change, and a destructuring assignment onto boxed `let`s writes the boxes
  in place; the `fallback`, `exclude_from_object`, and `array_slice` runtime
  helpers are gone. On the server a dynamic tag `<{tag} />` is lowered to
  `_$_.dynamic_element(tag, props)`, with the tag and the element's own props
  passed separately, so the props never carry an `is` entry.

### Patch Changes

- [#1458](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1458)
  [`bbc1445`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/bbc14455485e054c145ebc78f08a771d41ea16f1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Lighter list, `@if`, and
  mount output on the client. A controlled `@for` (the sole content of its
  element) appends its items into the parent instead of inserting before an empty
  text anchor, and an `@if` at the root of such an item creates an anchor only
  once it needs a position of its own (a branch swap, or a branch that renders
  nothing), so a keyed list of `@if` items keeps no anchor nodes in the DOM;
  `mount()` likewise renders into the target without an anchor node. An `@if`
  block now renders its branch directly and owns the branch's DOM range, and a
  list keeps its inputs in block state, so every `@if` and `@for` allocates one
  block less and no closures. Text and class updates compare against the last
  value in the render block's state instead of a cache on the DOM node; the
  compiler emits that compared form for single updates as well.

  A selector key whose subscribers all left stays in the selector's map for reuse
  when the key comes back, and is swept once more than 1024 released keys pile up.

- [#1469](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1469)
  [`b3a38ce`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b3a38ce0aae66a9dcac0b663c30161eed0d7547a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Add custom serialization for
  trackAsync hydration and RPC arguments/results using `transport` handlers in
  ripple.config.ts. Register matching encoders and decoders automatically in
  development and production, and expose `setTransport` for custom integrations.
  Apps without a transport retain the plain JSON hydration fast path. Provide a
  browser entry for config helpers so importing defineConfig does not load the
  Vite plugin's Node.js dependencies during hydration. A configured hydration
  payload embeds devalue's flattened form directly, so the client revives it
  without a second string encoding.

- [#1460](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1460)
  [`2ef5da5`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/2ef5da52b26fc13e11537dd28df0e2b376ca0f52)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Cheaper element refs,
  effects, and component templates on the client. A `ref` is one effect block
  keyed on its state instead of a render block that re-evaluates the thunk and
  creates a branch and an effect for it, since the ref value is read untracked and
  fixed for the life of the enclosing block. Effects deferred until a component
  has rendered are recorded as flat entries, and an effect's first run skips the
  child and teardown sweep. A tracked value written during a flush keeps its
  previous value for teardowns on itself instead of in a map, and `flushSync`
  releases those values when it finishes (they were only released by the microtask
  flush before).

  The compiler types the bindings of a destructured pattern
  (`{ item }: { item: Item }` as component props, or `const { item } = props` from
  a typed initializer), so their property reads lower to direct text and attribute
  writes. A component whose body has setup statements beside a single root element
  clones that element instead of a fragment.

- [#1470](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1470)
  [`0321791`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/03217912651e0a49edb8060a92602fd0e0abe193)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Component props are plain
  objects, evaluated once. A call site such as `<Child a={x} b="y" />` compiles to
  the object literal `{ a: x, b: 'y' }` and passes it to the component as is: no
  getters, no props class, no Proxy for spreads, no `Props` helpers, and no
  `Object.keys`/spread lowering, so props behave like any other object in `.tsrx`
  and `.ts` code alike. A prop expression is evaluated when the component is
  called, so a child that must follow a change now receives a live value
  explicitly: a tracked object (`count={count}`) or a derived
  (`title={track(() => label + count.value)}`), read through `.value`.
  `count={count.value}` passes the current number. `track(fn)` is typed
  `Derived<V>` with a read-only `value`; `track(fn, get, set)` or
  `track(fn, undefined, true)` is a `WritableDerived<V>`, and a write to a
  read-only derived warns in development. A dynamic element
  (`<{tag} class={x} />`) still updates its attributes reactively. `Props.keys`,
  `Props.values`, `Props.entries`, `Props.has`, `Props.spread`, `Props.rest`,
  `Props.ownSymbolKeys` and `Props.ownAllKeys` are removed, as they are plain
  `Object` operations now.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix hydration when a fragment
  root or a slot is followed by siblings. The compiler's closing `next(n)` for a
  fragment root now counts from wherever the cursor was last positioned, so a
  trailing element navigated to for an event or attribute, tracked text, a
  control-flow block, a component, or a `{expression}` no longer makes the cursor
  overshoot or fall short of the fragment's last node; a trailing element that was
  descended into is popped back to. Control-flow bodies nested inside an element
  now emit that `next(n)` too. At runtime, a `{expression}` leaves the cursor on
  its own end marker like every other block, and a multi-node branch or `@for`
  item steps to its block's end marker after appending, so the next sibling, item,
  or component adopts the right node.

  [`453bf4b`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/453bf4ba8b1b31963df26696545e446ab4b1658e)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Faster keyed lists and
  lighter component output on the client. A `@for` keyed by the item itself
  (`key item`) keys by identity with no key callback, so a re-run compares the
  item arrays directly and skips the per-item value update; a same-length keyed
  re-run rewrites the list's block array in place instead of allocating a new one,
  with the unchanged prefix and suffix skipped by plain compares. Static child
  components that follow their template siblings append into the parent element
  instead of inserting before a `<!>` placeholder, so a component with trailing
  child components clones fewer nodes and leaves no comment anchors in the DOM.
  The compiler also infers a primitive text type through a call whose callee is
  declared to return one (a binding typed as a function type, an `as` assertion, a
  function with a declared return type, or a method or function-typed property of
  an annotated object), so such text lowers to `set_text` instead of a generic
  expression block.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Faster cold hydration and
  server rendering. `hydrate()` accepts `rootBoundary: false` like `mount()`,
  stepping over the server's root marker itself instead of rendering under a `try`
  block (a streamed shell whose root suspended still hydrates under the default
  boundary, which alone can adopt and activate its slot). The client runtime
  compiles less on a cold page: the hydration cursor steps live in one module and
  assign the cursor directly, a list's first render never compiles the diff, a
  template's clone path stays out of its hydrating closure, `run_block` keeps
  re-run and teardown handling in separate functions, and the compiler adopts an
  element's lone text child in place (`hydrate_text`) with no `pop()`. A `@for`
  whose `index` nothing reads allocates no tracked index per item. Removing the
  server's inline styles now starts from an animation frame rather than inside
  `mount()`/`hydrate()`.

  On the server, `render()` joins its buffer tree with a plain walk instead of
  `flat(Infinity).join('')`, `escape()` returns strings without `&`, `<` or `"`
  after a single regex test, and an `Output` allocates its stream, css and
  async-operation collections only for the root or on first use.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Speed up portals and root
  event delegation. `<Portal>` now lowers to a dedicated `portal()` runtime call,
  portal content appends straight into its target without a placeholder node,
  delegated root listeners are shared per target instead of per portal, event
  registration no longer scans every root target, and `@if` blocks and compiled
  `event()` calls allocate fewer closures. `mount()` accepts `rootBoundary: false`
  to render without the default root try/pending boundary. Cold code paths
  (keyed-list diff, block error handling, effect-phase flushing, hydration
  branches) live in their own functions so a first mount compiles less. A
  component whose root is `@if`, `@for`, `@switch`, or `@try` now re-renders at
  its own position when it is portal content or one of an element's all-component
  children, instead of at the end of the parent; `mount()`/`hydrate()` disposers
  are safe to call more than once.

  [`0321791`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/03217912651e0a49edb8060a92602fd0e0abe193)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Cheaper component
  instantiation and `@if` chains on the client. An `@else if`, and a branch whose
  only statement is another `@if`, fold into the enclosing `@if` block on both the
  client and the server, so a chain costs one block and one hydration boundary. An
  `@if` whose condition reads no tracked state renders its branch directly under
  the enclosing block with no block of its own (a block without dependencies is
  never scheduled, so nothing is lost); a dynamic condition keeps its block and
  adopts the dependencies recorded while it was evaluated. A module-level
  component also carries a direct render entry so `render_component` skips the
  element it would otherwise return. An `@if` condition and its branches compile
  to module-level functions when they capture at most one local (passed through
  the if runtime), a condition returns the branch function to render instead of
  calling a selection callback, and a render block's function is module-level with
  its captured locals carried on the block state, so a component instantiation
  creates no closures for its ifs or its reactive text and attribute updates.
  `Context.get()` walks a chain of the context entries that were set rather than
  every ancestor component. A module-level component's render body is a
  module-level function that receives the props from the element instead of a
  closure created per instantiation, `Context.get()`/`set()` calls on a
  `new Context()` binding skip the `with_scope` wrapper, and `mount()` only
  schedules the SSR style removal when the page has server-rendered inline styles.
  A `@switch` now lowers onto the same runtime as `@if`: its selector returns the
  case to render, so a `@switch` over a value that reads no tracked state renders
  its case with no block, its cases are module-level functions when they capture
  at most one local, and the separate switch runtime is gone. The probe that
  decides whether an `@if` needs a block now renders a static branch itself, one
  runtime call instead of four. A module-level component with a destructuring
  parameter gets the direct render entry as well, and an `@if` or `@switch` is
  hoisted whatever number of locals it captures: several travel as one object
  literal destructured in the hoisted signatures. A binding that hoisted template
  code writes (a `ref={name}` setter, a handler that assigns it) or that is
  reassigned after template code reads it is compiled to a `{ v }` box, so the
  hoisted functions share the variable with the component exactly as a closure
  would: a plain `let`, a name inside a destructuring pattern of any shape, a
  function or catch parameter (reboxed first thing in the body), and a `let`
  written through a destructuring or `for...of` assignment target.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - A derived created during a
  block's run (a `track(() => ...)` or `tracked.readOnly()` in an `@if` branch, a
  keyed `@for` item, a render expression, or component setup) is now unsubscribed
  from its sources when that block reruns or is destroyed, unless a reader that is
  still alive holds it. Before, such deriveds stayed subscribed until the block
  that owned them was destroyed, so a branch that toggled repeatedly accumulated
  one stale derived per toggle, each walked on every write to the source. The
  bookkeeping lives in a side table keyed by the creating block, so blocks that
  create no deriveds pay nothing.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Faster streaming SSR. A
  resolved `trackAsync` value made of plain data (strings, finite numbers,
  booleans, `null`, arrays and plain objects, each reachable once) now travels in
  its hydration script as raw JSON that `JSON.parse` of the envelope yields
  directly, instead of a devalue-encoded string; values JSON cannot represent
  (`undefined`, `NaN`, `-0`, bigints, Dates, Maps, Sets, shared references,
  cycles) keep the devalue encoding, and the client reads either form. Boundaries
  that settle in the same task (data arriving together, a batch of promises
  resolved by one timer or I/O callback) stream as one chunk, flushed once the
  task's microtasks have drained; closing the stream flushes whatever is still
  queued first. `devalue` is updated to 5.9.2, with the stringify performance
  patch proposed upstream in sveltejs/devalue#190 applied through pnpm's
  `patchedDependencies` until it is released.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - `tracked.readOnly()` returns
  a read-only view of a `Tracked` or `WritableDerived`: a `Derived<V>` that
  follows the value and rejects writes, for a child, function, or context that
  should only read it. It is equivalent to `track(() => tracked.value)`. On a
  derived that is already read-only, `readOnly()` returns the derived itself.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Faster updates and list
  rendering in the client runtime. Tracked values now keep a subscriber list, so a
  write schedules exactly the blocks that read it and the flush no longer scans
  the owner's subtree; scheduled blocks run in creation order from a queue. Text
  expressions, keyed list items, and class updates allocate less per row, and
  `set_class` skips DOM writes when the class is unchanged. Adds the `selector` /
  `selector_match` internals the compiler uses to share one subscription across
  `outer === item` comparisons in `@for` templates. Keyed list reconciliation
  matches moved end items before falling back to the map and LIS, so reversals,
  rotations, and swaps complete with plain moves. An empty dynamic `class` no
  longer writes a `class=""` attribute; the server omits it as well. Exposes
  `hydrating`, `hydrate_child`, and `hydrate_sibling` from the internal client
  entry for the compiler's inline traversal. When most surviving items of a keyed
  list would have to move, the list is re-laid in order before a fixed node, which
  is cheaper than moving each item into place.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Implement sibling-scoped
  `<style>` blocks, `$class`, and `apply`
  ([TSRX RFC #1](https://github.com/tsrx-org/RFCs/discussions/1)) for the Ripple
  target.

  - A `<style>` block is scoped to its siblings: it styles the items beside it and
    everything below them, never the element that contains it. Blocks among the
    same children share one hash and one stylesheet; nested children lists that
    hold blocks are nested scopes, and every element carries the hash of each
    enclosing scope, outer first. Control-flow branches and templates assigned to
    variables host scopes too.
  - Assigning a block to a variable exposes `$class`. Exported, applied, or
    `$class`-read blocks are themes that keep every selector; other assigned
    blocks stay class maps. `<style apply={theme} />` attaches a theme to a whole
    scope, `<style apply={theme}>…</style>` applies and declares in one tag,
    arrays apply several themes, and a theme may apply other themes. Same-module
    themes inline as literals; imported themes are read through `theme.$class` at
    runtime.
  - CSS is emitted in lexical order (an applied theme before the block that
    applies it, a scope's blocks together, nested scopes after their parent). On
    the server a render registers the sheets it needs in that order, class-map
    reads register their own sheet, and reading `theme.$class` outside a render no
    longer throws.
  - The style diagnostics of the RFC (`tsrx-style-*` codes) are reported, and
    type-only output verifies `apply` targets through a `$class` read.
  - Fixed: a `@{ … }` block rendered as the child of a DOM element on the client
    was dropped; it now renders in place. The `#class` spread attribute accepts
    several class tokens.

  Raw CSS in a `<style>` inside a plain function that returns JSX is now an error
  (`tsrx-style-standalone-outside-template`): use a `@{ … }` body, or
  `<style>{css}</style>`. Elements are stamped with the scope class after their
  authored classes, and every element of a scope carries it, not only those a
  selector matches.

  Thanks [@chenzylab](https://github.com/chenzylab)! - Fix event delegation
  breaking when multiple roots (Portals, mounts) share or mix targets.

  - `handle_root_events(target)` had no notion of multiple callers sharing the
    same `target` element. Each Portal (or the app root) calls it once on mount;
    its cleanup unconditionally removed the delegated event listeners from
    `target`. When two Portals both mount to `document.body` (e.g. a Modal and a
    SideSheet), closing the first tore down the delegated listeners for
    `document.body` entirely, silently breaking every click inside the second — no
    error, no warning. `handle_root_events` now ref-counts callers per target, and
    the delegated listeners are only torn down once every caller for that target
    has released it.
  - The single `root_target` global is gone. `on()` now checks the element against
    every active root target, so attaching a listener directly to one root's
    target while another root (e.g. a Portal to a sibling layer) was acquired
    later no longer silently takes the broken delegated path.
  - `Portal` acquires root event delegation in its own render block keyed on
    `target`, so a children-only update no longer releases and re-adds every
    delegated listener on the target.

  The pure-insert reconciliation path resolved the DOM anchor per new item by
  indexing the old blocks with a new-list index, so the anchor drifted into the
  matched suffix and later items landed after it (e.g. `[A, C, D]` →
  `[A, B1, B2, C, D]` rendered as `A, B1, C, B2, D`). The anchor is now resolved
  once, at the start of the matched suffix, and reused for the whole run of
  inserts.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - fix(types): widen
  `Component`'s return type to everything the runtime renders

  `Component` declared `(props: T) => void | TSRXElement`, so a component that
  returned a string, number, bigint, boolean, `null`, or an array — all of which
  both runtimes render — was rejected at `mount`, `hydrate`, and the server
  `render`. The return type is now the new exported `Renderable` union, which
  mirrors the shared dispatch in `render_value`/`render_expression`: elements
  render, arrays flatten recursively, nullish renders nothing, everything else is
  stringified. Promises, functions, and symbols stay rejected because neither
  runtime renders them.

  [`fea49bf`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/fea49bfb4410a05e0c915dfa39acdaba7f542737)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Streaming SSR:
  `render(App, { stream })` now streams progressively. The synchronous shell (with
  pending fallbacks for suspended `@try` boundaries and all CSS registered so far)
  is flushed immediately; each boundary's content streams out of order as a framed
  chunk once its async work settles, including per-chunk CSS, trackAsync envelopes
  and `<head>` content. A tiny inline runtime swaps chunks into their slots before
  hydration, and hydrated boundaries activate streamed chunks in place afterwards
  — claiming the streamed DOM without re-rendering. Catch-only async boundaries
  stream an empty slot and resolve to their body or server-rendered catch; errors
  whose catch region is already on the wire hand off to the client boundary via an
  error envelope. `render` also gains a `streamTemplate` option for document
  scaffolding, and the vite plugin streams render-route responses when
  `ssr.streaming` is enabled in ripple.config.ts (falling back to buffered SSR
  when index.html lacks the `<!--ssr-head-->`/`<!--ssr-body-->` markers).

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix
  `Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'parent' in null` thrown from `append()`
  when reordering or inserting into a keyed `@for` whose item body is a single
  control-flow / component root (e.g. `@for (...; key ...) { <Card {item} /> }`
  where `Card`'s own body is a single `@if`/`@for`/component). The 0.3.85
  wrapper-anchor optimization leaves such an item block's `s.start` null because
  its DOM is rendered through a descendant block, and keyed reconciliation read
  `s.start` directly as the insertion anchor. Reconciliation now resolves the real
  first/last DOM node by descending child blocks, so no `<!>` comment marker is
  reintroduced and the optimization's reduced DOM-mutation cost is preserved. The
  same resolution is applied to `@switch` case reordering.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Skip the wrapper anchor for
  single control-flow / code-block / component root scopes. When a scope's entire
  renderable output is a single `@if`, `@switch`, `@for`, `@try`, or static child
  component — i.e. a component body, a control-flow branch, or a `@{}` body whose
  only output after setup is one of these — the compiler now renders it directly
  before the parent-provided `__anchor` instead of synthesizing a `<!>` fragment
  wrapper and an extra append + clone. For deep recursive trees this measurably
  cuts mount time and shrinks generated output; in the recursive-context benchmark
  it brought mount DOM operations to one clone + one append per element (from
  ~1.5×) and halved the comment-anchor nodes.

  Hydration is preserved. The control-flow runtimes
  (`if_block`/`switch_block`/`for_block`/`for_block_keyed`/`try_block`) capture
  the SSR boundary marker and hand it to `append()` afterward, so the existing
  context-aware cursor advance still runs — including for a root scope used as a
  child of a composite/slot with following siblings. Single-component roots need
  no runtime change at all, since a component's own content advances the hydration
  cursor.

  Also relaxes the compiler's text-expression detection: `string + anything` (e.g.
  `{a + '|' + b}`) is now recognized as text and lowered to the fast `set_text`
  path without requiring an explicit `as string`, since such an expression always
  evaluates to a string in JS.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Scope the client flush
  traversal to the updated subtree. Previously every flush walked the whole root
  block tree to find dirty subscribers, so a deeply-scoped update (e.g. mutating
  state read by only a small subtree) paid a cost proportional to the entire tree
  rather than the affected branch. `flush_updates` now descends only along the
  routing path to each directly-scheduled block and fully scans just that block's
  subtree, where its subscribers live. A tracked read from outside its owner's
  subtree (e.g. smuggled across sibling subtrees via a module-level variable) is
  detected in `register_dependency` and transparently falls back to the original
  full-tree scan, so behavior is unchanged.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Treat plain JS control flow
  inside `@{ … }` as ordinary JavaScript that returns JSX.

  Only `@`-directives (`@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try`) lower to template control
  flow. Plain `if`/`for`/`for…of`/`for…in`/`while`/`do…while`/`switch`/`try`
  inside a code block are now compiled exactly like the same control flow in a
  regular `function C() { …; return <jsx> }` body — their JSX returns become
  `tsrx_element` values rather than being template-ized.

  Previously these plain statements were mis-routed into the template transform:
  on **ripple** an early-return guard produced a `_$_.if`/`_$_.switch`/`_$_.try`
  wrapper (with dead code in the `switch`/`try` cases) and plain loops threw a
  compile error; on **solid** they produced
  `<Show>`/`<Switch>`/`<For>`/`<Errored>` (dropping trailing output for `try`).
  They now stay as plain control flow, so early-return guards and loops behave
  like normal JavaScript.

  As part of this, the ripple client and server targets no longer emit the
  `return_guard` bookkeeping variable: a plain early `return` is a real early
  return, so subsequent template output is naturally skipped without a guard flag.

  On **solid**, this means a plain guard (`if (signal()) return …`) inside a
  component body now runs once at setup — exactly like a regular Solid component —
  instead of being lifted into a reactive `<Show>`. Use `@if` (or another
  `@`-directive) when you want reactive conditional rendering.

  sites normalize `children` via `normalize_children`, but props passed through

### Patch Changes

- [#1240](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1240)
  [`92982ee`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/92982ee5cd2e6d971b5b650ec1df70483c9716aa)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Render `<{expr}>` dynamic
  tags directly through `_$_.composite` in the client production output instead of
  lowering to the `Dynamic` helper component, and fix hydration of dynamic string
  tags claiming the SSR-rendered element.

- [#1241](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1241)
  [`b826234`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b8262342111a977ba5a0d44086154e386b06f4b9)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Remove the runtime `Dynamic`
  component exports; dynamic rendering is the `<{expr}>` tag syntax. The `Dynamic`
  type declarations remain so type-only output keeps type-checking, but the JS is
  gone: React and Preact production output now lowers dynamic tags to a scoped
  component alias (`const TsrxDynamic_N = expr;`), Ripple SSR uses the internal
  `_$_.dynamic_element` helper, and the imported-`Dynamic` detection for scoped
  CSS is removed (the element marking is now `metadata.dynamicElement`, set by the
  dynamic-tag lowering).

  [`6fd49c9`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/6fd49c9dd737e889844e254763f66e13ea4a7241)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace the removed `<@...>`
  dynamic tag syntax with runtime `Dynamic` helpers. Ripple now exports `Dynamic`
  and reuses its composite runtime path for dynamic elements/components, while
  React, Preact, Solid, and Vue expose target-specific `Dynamic` helpers with
  typed `is` props.

  React, Preact, Solid, and Vue now mark imported runtime `Dynamic` elements
  during shared JSX analysis so scoped CSS classes are applied through aliases
  without treating local components named `Dynamic` as runtime elements.

  Dynamic component prop forwarding now uses a shared core runtime helper that
  excludes the internal `is` prop without snapshotting getter-backed reactive
  props.

  The TSRX parser, transforms, analyzers, prettier support, and related tests no
  longer recognize dynamic tag syntax. Stale JSX identifier `tracked` plumbing
  from that parser path has also been removed.

  [`054bd1e`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/054bd1e75347e395f6c096f8e293d1baf8e03549)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Parse tags and bare fragments
  as native TSRX by default, remove `component` keyword parsing, and
  compile/format/lint function components that return native TSRX across the
  React, Preact, Solid, Vue, and Ripple targets. Ripple component compilation now
  only renders TSRX reachable from returned values and supports string and `null`
  component returns.

  Ripple now also preserves directly called PascalCase helpers as ordinary
  functions while still compiling renderable component functions used as
  components or render entries.

  The old explicit TSRX wrapper tag is no longer special; TSRX elements and
  fragments are the default expression syntax, and the tag name is treated like
  any ordinary element name.

  Ripple now exports a typed `Fragment` helper from its public runtimes and
  supports `innerHTML` on both host elements and `Fragment`. Ripple also treats
  `innerHTML` from element spreads as rendered content instead of serializing it
  as an `innerhtml` attribute.

  The `{html ...}` template directive has been removed. Use each target's native
  raw HTML prop instead, such as `innerHTML` for Ripple/Solid/Vue or
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for React/Preact.

  The `{text ...}` template directive has also been removed. Text values now use
  ordinary `{expr}` containers, with explicit coercion written as JavaScript
  (`String(value)`, `value + ''`, or a typed string value). Ripple optimizes
  clearly string-shaped expressions and typed string props into text-node updates
  without requiring a TSRX-specific directive.

  typings to infer specific DOM event types. Improve all JSX types for much
  improved typescript support. Mark self-closing JSX tokens as completion-capable
  so empty attribute positions can surface editor completions. Fix no intellisense
  on dom attributes when <style> blocks were present Share scoped CSS selector
  metadata across TSRX targets so class-name definitions work outside Ripple too.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace `node:crypto` usage
  in the compiler with a pure-JS implementation so Ripple can be compiled inside
  browser workers (e.g. the Monaco-based playground) where `crypto.createHash` is
  not available.

  The hashing utility is split into two functions:
  - `simple_hash` — fast non-cryptographic djb2 (base36). Used for CSS class-name
    prefixes and runtime `{html}` hydration markers where the input is user
    content and the output multiplies across the shipped bundle.
  - `strong_hash` — preimage-resistant SHA-256 prefix (pure-JS via
    `@noble/hashes`). Used everywhere a hash is derived from a server-only
    filesystem path (`#server` RPC ids, `track`/`trackAsync` ids, head-element
    hydration markers) so the hash can't be inverted to reveal the original path.

  The runtime `ripple` package no longer ships its own `hashing.js` — it
  re-exports `simple_hash`/`strong_hash` from `@tsrx/core`, and the compiler emits
  `_$_.simple_hash` (previously `_$_.hash`) for dynamic `{html}` hydration
  markers.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Restore the `ripple/compiler`
  subpath export. The compiler was moved into `@tsrx/ripple` during the
  Ripple/TSRX split, which accidentally dropped `ripple/compiler` from the
  published `exports` map — breaking downstream tooling that imports the compiler
  by the public path, including `livecodes` and any playground served through
  `esm.sh`. The path now re-exports the `@tsrx/ripple` API (`compile`, `parse`,
  `compile_to_volar_mappings`, and the shared types), and `@tsrx/ripple` is
  promoted to a runtime dependency so the re-export resolves for installed
  consumers.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Add a release changeset for
  the async tracking work introduced in commit
  `4eb4d6851573d771d65f1e85b1b442ad3cdc53d2`.

  This ships async tracking as a first-class feature in Ripple:
  - remove and prohibit direct component-level `await`; async component flows now
    require using `trackAsync()` (with `trackPending()` for pending state checks)
  - add `trackAsync()` and `trackPending()` support so async values can be read
    through Ripple's reactive runtime using tracked async values
  - update compiler/runtime behavior for `try`/`catch`/`pending` boundaries so
    async pending and error states can render and recover correctly in client and
    SSR paths
  - align `@ripple-ts/compat-react` async boundary behavior with the new Ripple
    async tracking semantics
  - update editor/tooling integration to match the new async syntax/runtime shape

  Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Fix
  HMR "zoom" issue when a Ripple file is changed in the dev server.

  When a layout component contained children with nested `if`/`for` blocks,
  hydration would leave `hydrate_node` pointing deep inside the layout's root
  element (e.g. a HYDRATION_END comment inside `<main>`). The `append()`
  function's `parentNode === dom` check only handled direct children, so it missed
  grandchild/deeper positions and incorrectly updated the branch block's `s.end`
  to that deep internal node.

  This caused two problems on HMR re-render:
  1. `remove_block_dom(s.start, s.end)` removed wrong elements (the deep node was
     treated as a sibling boundary, causing removal of unrelated content including
     the root HYDRATION_END comment).
  2. `target = hydrate_node` (set after the initial render) became `null` or
     pointed outside the component's region, so new content was inserted at the
     wrong DOM location — producing a layout that appeared "zoomed" because it
     rendered outside its CSS container context.

  The fix changes the `parentNode === dom` check to `dom.contains(hydrate_node)`,
  consistent with the `anchor === dom` branch that already used `dom.contains()`.
  This correctly resets `hydrate_node` to `dom`'s sibling level regardless of how
  deeply nested it was inside `dom`.

### Patch Changes

  [`a9ecda4`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/a9ecda4e3f29e3b934d9f5ee80d55c059ba36ebe)
  Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Fix
  catch block not executing when used with pending block in try statements.
  Previously, errors thrown inside async components within
  `try { ... } pending { ... } catch { ... }` blocks were lost as unhandled
  promise rejections. Now errors are properly caught and the catch block is
  rendered. Also fixes the server-side rendering to not include pending content in
  the final output when the async operation resolves or errors.

  [`6653c5c`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/6653c5cebfbd4dce129906a25686ef9c63dc592a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix compiler analysis
  incorrectly marking untrackable nodes as tracked. `MemberExpression` now only
  enables tracking when the member or its property is actually marked as
  `tracked`, and unconditional tracking side-effects were removed from
  `CallExpression` and `NewExpression` visitors.

  Also fixes the client transform for `TrackedExpression` in TypeScript mode to
  emit a `['#v']` member access (marked as `tracked`) instead of the runtime
  `_$_.get(...)` call, aligning TSX output with tracked-access semantics.

  [`307dcf3`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/307dcf30f27dae987a19a59508cc2593c839eda3)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix client HMR updates when a
  wrapped component has not mounted yet. The runtime now avoids calling `set()` on
  an undefined tracked source and keeps wrapper HMR state synchronized across
  update chains.

  [`96a5614`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/96a56141de8aa667a64bf53ad06f63292e38b1d9)
  Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Add
  invalid HTML nesting error detection during SSR in dev mode

  During SSR, if the HTML is malformed (e.g., `<button>` elements nested inside
  other `<button>` elements), the browser tries to repair the HTML, making
  hydration impossible. This change adds runtime validation of HTML nesting during
  SSR to detect these cases and provide clear error messages.
  - Added `push_element` and `pop_element` functions to the server runtime that
    track the element stack during SSR
  - Added comprehensive HTML nesting validation rules based on the HTML spec
  - The server compiler now emits `push_element`/`pop_element` calls when the
    `dev` option is enabled
  - Added `dev` option to `CompileOptions`
  - The Vite plugin now automatically enables dev mode during `vite dev` (serve
    command)

  Thanks [@WebEferen](https://github.com/WebEferen)! - Fix SSR hydration output
  for early-return guarded content by emitting hydration block markers around
  return-guarded regions, and add hydration/server coverage for early return
  scenarios.
